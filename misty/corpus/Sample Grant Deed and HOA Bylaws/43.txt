PAYMENTS

When an owner makes a payment, he or she may request a receipt, and the association is
required to provide it. On the receipt, the association must indicate the date of payment and the person who
received it. The association must inform owners of amailing address for overnight payments. (Section 1367.1
of the Civil Code)

An owner may dispute an assessment debt by submitting a written request for dispute resolution to
the association as set forth in Article 5 (commencing with Section 1368.810) of Chapter 4 of Title 6 of
Division 2 of the Civil Code. In addition, an association may not initiate a foreclosure without participating
in alternative dispute resolution with a neutral third party as set forth in Article 2 (commencing with Section

arbitration shall not be available if the association intends to
initiate a judicial foreclosure.

An owner is not liable for charges, interest, and costs of collection, if it is established that the
assessment was paid properly on time. (Section 1367.1 of the Civil Code)
