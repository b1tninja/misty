2) Common Area Problems

 

Problems or complaints concerning common area maintenance or usage should be submitted
through the Management Company or to the Board of Directors. As the Homeowner's Association
matures, committee heads may be set up to monitor all complaints and aid in the timely correction of
any problem area.

3) Problems With Neighbors

 

Hopefully this will not occur, however, sometimes there does develop a problem with a neighbor
over the parking of vehicles, loud and excessive noise, animals, etc. These complaints should be
made to the Management Company. The Management Company, in turn, will send a letter stating
the violation or disturbance and enforce, through the Board of Directors, any fine which the
Association has set up for such occurrence. At times the enforcement may necessitate the
notification of local police.

4) Utility, Water, Gas, Fire Problems

 

Depending upon the nature of the problem or emergency contact the appropriate agency
FIRST. It is best to receive immediate service in the event of these type problems, and of course, in
the event of an emergency. The Management Company should also be aware of these situations, as
it allows for a monitor of types of problems recurring. Occasionally problems within these areas, if
recurring in any frequency, denotes a single major problem. Be sure to keep handy the emergency
telephone numbers for the local companies and official agencies.
