If the delinquent assessment installment, together with any late charges, interest and costs
incurred is not paid in full within 45 days from the due date, a written notice of default and demand
for payment shall be mailed to the delinquent owner(s) advising them of the intent of the
Association to record a "Notice of Delinquent Assessment."

If payment in full is not received within 15 days of receipt of the written notice of default
and demand for payment, a "Notice of Delinquent Assessment" may be recorded with the
Sacramento County Recorder's Office establishing a lien on the owner's interest for the unpaid
delinquent assessment(s) together with late charges, interest and costs incurred for collection
including attorney fees, mailing costs and lien preparation and filing costs.

If payment in full is not received within 30 days of the recording of the "Notice of
Delinquent Assessment‚Äù, the Association may initiate a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of the
lien or bring legal action against the owner personally obligated to pay the delinquent assessment
installment without foreclosure or waiver of the lien and/or securing the same.

As a general rule, from and after the time that this Association commences enforcement
proceedings to prepare and record the "Notice of Delinquent Assessment", partial payments will not
be accepted and all amounts due to this Association, including without limitation current
assessments due and preparatory enforcement fees and costs, must be paid to avoid further
enforcement action. Not withstanding the foregoing, acceptance of partial payments by or on behalf
of this Association, whether inadvertently or intentionally, shall not constitute a waiver by this
Association of its enforcement remedies, and such remedies may proceed as to any remaining
balance due to this Association.

All payments will be applied to an owner's account first to the principal sum owed, then in
descending order, to interest, late charges, collection expenses unless a payment agreement and
forbearance agreement is executed between the Association and the Owner.

The Board of Directors of this Association (the "Board") may from time to time revise this
policy, either generally or on a case-by-case basis, where the Board determines that such action
would be in the best interests of this Association; provided, however, that no such revisions shall
increase the amount of late charges or shorten the time periods for actions specified above unless
such revision shall be applied generally to all lots governed by this Association and advance notice
thereof is given to the members of this Association.

This Assessment Collection Policy shall also apply to collection of any and all special
assessments approved by the Board or the membership.
