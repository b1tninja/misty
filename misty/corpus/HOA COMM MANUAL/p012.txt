Please remember that you must get approval BEFORE making any
changes.

Alterations, additions or modifications made to the exterior surfaces of
your unit or Exclusive Use Common Area patio, deck or garage must
have prior written approval from the Board of Directors. No Unit shall
be altered in any manner which would result in an increase in sound
transmission, resonance or reverberations to any other Unit. Only soft-
cover floors may be installed on the lower levels of Units, except for
replacement of any hard coverings in kitchen, bath or other areas where
such hard coverings were originally installed by Declarant.

Any alterations that do not have prior written approval by the Board of
Directors will be removed by the homeowner and the area will be restored to
its original condition. Should the homeowner fail to comply, the work will
be contracted out and billed to the homeowner. Bills not paid are subject to
lien.

In addition, the Board of Directors may also assess fines of not less than
$10.00 per day or more than $50.00 per day for non-compliance of Board
requests to have non-approved alterations restored to their original condition.
