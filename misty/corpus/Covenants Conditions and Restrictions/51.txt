15.3  Restatements. This section describes the methods for restating the Declaration after an

amendment.

the Members, to restate this Declaration when it has been properly amended pursuant to its

document, with these exceptions: (i) changes incorporating all amendments approved the Owners;
(ii) changes made to rearrange or delete the text for consistency with the approved amendments: (iii)
changes made to delete material no longer legally effective or legally required, suchas the provisions
described in Article 14 once Declarant no longer owns any portion of the Overall Development; (iv)
the addition of a statement that the Board has authorized the restatement pursuant to this section; (v)
changes made to delete any provision declared illegal by constitutional or statutory enactment, by
regulation, or by controlling judicial opinion; and (vi) changes needed to distinguish the restatement
from the original document, such as title, section, or subsection numbering changes.
