(8) Foreclosure Eliminates Unpaid Assessments. Notwithstanding any other provisions
in this Declaration, each holder of a First Mortgage lien who comes into possession of the Unit by
virtue of foreclosure shall not be liable for more than six (6) months of the Unit's unpaid Regular
Assessments or charges accrued before acquisition of the title to the Unit by the Mortgagee. If the
Association's lien priority includes costs of collecting unpaid dues, the Mortgagor shall be liable for
any fees or costs related to the collection of the unpaid dues.

 

(h) Compliance with FHA/VA, FHLMC or FNMA Requirements. Declarant intended
that the Development should comply with all of the requirements of the FHA, VA, FHLMC and
FNMA. All property and liability insurance covering any portion of the Development encumbered
by a Mortgage insured by FHA, guaranteed by VA, or held by FHLMC or FNMA, shall therefore
conform to the applicable FHA/VA, FHLMC or FNMA requirements. Declarant and all Unit
Owners also agree that in the event the Development or the Governing Documents do not comply
with the applicable FHA/VA, FHLMC or FNMA requirements, the Board and each Owner shall take
any action or adopt any resolutions required by any First Mortgagee to conform such Governing
Documents, or the Development, to the FHA/VA, FHLMC or FNMA requirements.

ARTICLE 13 ANNEXATIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATIONS

13.1 Annexation of Subsequent Phase Property. Declarant shall have the right to annex all or any
portions of the Subsequent Phase Property to the Development so as to be subject to this Declaration and so
that membership in the Association shall be appurtenant to ownership of Condominium within the annexing
Phase. Such annexation shall not require the approval of either the Association or the Owners so long as the

affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the voting power of Members other than Declarant. Upon obtaining
